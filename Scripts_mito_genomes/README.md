#Mitochondrial Genome Assembly

The mitochondrial genome sequence of each individual was obtained from Illumina HiSeq reads (after adapter trimming but no other processing) using NOVOplasty 4.3.1 (Dierckxsens et al. 2017). K-mer was set to the default value of 33 and one mitogenome of Alouatta seniculus (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_027825.1) was obtained from GenBank and used as the bait reference.
